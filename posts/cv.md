I'm a results-driven, action-biased technology leader. I believe in strategic pragmatism, where strategy is spelled out in measurable effort and projected results. I have worked at the nexus of business development, technology and executive leadership as the 'glue' that brings conversations to a fruitful conclusion throughout my career, often acting as translator, facilitator or mediator as the case may be. I've played this role where economic, technical, geographic and cultural gaps exist and emerge with a richer collaboration and communication as a direct result of my involvement. Technical solutions are contingent on the people involved, and I am often the 'people person' in the room. I have been steeping in the economics and infrastructure of the energy transition for the last 5 years and learn something new everyday. 

As a mentor and member of the community, I advise startups on best approaches to building teams and products. I'm a self-taught engineer, holding music degrees in composition and theory. Most of what you see of me online is music related. I travel by bike whenever possible.

# Philosophy

As leaders, the job often boils down to these core tenets (in no particular order):

- Expand the capacity of the organization (often by debugging the organization)
- Remove obstacles preventing my people from doing their best work
- Report the truth objectively, to my stakeholders and my team.

Material-incented work is a thing of the past; purpose is what motivates. We will be left behind if we fail to tie purpose to action.

Parent - Child relationships reinforce bad habits. Actively elevate every relationship to adult-adult. Move away from Command/Comply to Mutual Accountability

# Job History

## Fiuturx - VP, Technology

March 2023 - Present

Fiutur spun out of Xpansiv to focus specifically on the demand for traceable, transparent data backing environmental claims. Once again, I joined as the technical voice for business development and began leading engineering (team of 6) x`	when the organization needed structure.

- Built delivery process to keep visibility on execution across vendors and FTE.
- Key stakeholder in establishing policies for SOC audit. 
- Individual contributor on prototypes and projects in Java and Haskell.
- Due diligence point of contact for acquirers and potential acquisition targets.
- IT and Engineering budget owner.
- Technical partner point of contact. 
- Created technical engagement model for Fiutur data platform.


## Xpansiv  - VP, Engineering

October 2018 - Feb 2023

I joined Xpansiv as the technical POC for our Business Development team, moving to VP Engineering in Feb 2020 as we grew. Xpansiv had a variety of challenges associated with rapid inorganic growth; our strategy involved acquiring multiple operators in the environmental commodities space, roughly 2-3 acquisitions or mergers a year. As a result, I spun many plates managing the tension between keeping a working dev team energized and delivering, and creating momentum with newly acquired teams and technologies.

- Led a relocation/reorg effort timed right at the beginning of the pandemic. Lots of remote culture learnings.
- Technical owner of multiple due diligence conversations as we evaluated M+A opportunities. Primarily, this was us acquiring others.
- Owner of product delivery for environmental market infrastructure.
- Led cultural / HR conversations with teams joining the Xpansiv family.
- Defined and ran recruiting pipelines and processes to support agressive growth strategy.
- Ran point on SOC responses for IT, Change Management, Incident Response, etc.

- Built Engineering and QA capabilities across teams by orchestrating collaboration between vendor and internal teams across many time zones.

## Globant - VP, Technology

January-October, 2018

Globant–a multi-national services organization as the name suggests–acquired L4 as well as two other US-based services agencies. I was a leader in integrating the US-based organizations while keeping my team of 30 thriving and deliverying. After integration, I was responsible for a team of roughly 80 engineers across dozens of projects, and was involvled in scaling our PMO and Business Development capabilities as a result. Most of this was project-based worked with relatively fixed deliverables, so revising playbooks and general doctrine around delivery process, legal, billing and handoff to customers was pithy given Globant's cultural reach and, therefore, diversity across Latin America, Europe, Asia and the (at the time) newly established US presence. 


- Key strategist for talent acquisition and retention. Created playbooks, HR materials, recruiting materials, salary banding, interpersonal management materials for career-pathing.
- Defined and drove recruiting process to support agressive growth strategy.
- IT and Engineering budget owner.
- Partnered with PMO and Commercial team to refine practices and processes to refine sales pipeline and grow delivery capacity.
- Refined engagement model to map to Globant model on new business as well as smoothly transitioning established clients, maintaining trust and collaboration along the way.
- Gave presentations on technical growth and client engagement strategy. 


## L4 Digital - Director, Engineering

October 2015-January 2018

I joined L4 as Director of Engineering and became steward of a stellar team of 30 engineers. This was a time for many organizations when mobile development was being brought in-house and other endpoints, like smart TVs and set top boxes, we're a hotspot for vendors. Consequently, the culture we established with our partners we called "team augmentation" as opposed to staff augmentation. We enjoyed strong relationships with customers whose technical capabilities we helped establish and grow. My role, as is often the case, was to retain my engineers in a space with high turnover, and grow our consulting capabilities by attracting new talent being courted by larger product-based organizations. 

- Developed and drove recruiting strategy with a dedicated recruiting vendor local to the northwest.
- IT and Engineering budget owner.
- Technical representative on every client engagement.
- Technical point for qualification and execution of work, including generating RFP responses, crafting and statements of work and feasible, measurable acceptance criteria clear to clients. This last point often involved a lot of investment in client facetime as technical representative.
- IC on multiple projects.


# Ancient History 

## Rainspark Labs/Artifact Technologies - VP, Engineering

November 2011-2015

Artifact was a startup focused on very local location-based experiences. We utilized GPS, proximity to WiFi access point and Bluetooth LE beacons to provide 'in the room' engagement with audiences and customers in gaming, way-finding in museums and live music contexts. I grew the team from a single engineer (myself) to a product delivery organization of about a dozen, including design, product management, qa. Essentially the acting CTO, I also was the technical voice in all fundraising and board communications. This is one of two experiences I have in bringing a startup from a couple of founders to a bustling office.  I was very passionate about our location-aware local music experiences and still feel the product has legs, probably to Live Nation or something of similar scale in today's music world. 

- Architected and developed a proprietary platform for the authoring and delivering rich content collections as tied to location.  
- Acted as primary developer on backend, mobile and web clients as we grew to fill engineering positions for each skill set.
- Deployed our location-based solution for wayfinding, content creation and real-time distribution, and direct communication to audiences at local music festivals, museums and comic-cons.  This last adventure was a high-water-mark networking challenge, for sure.
- Built a predecessor to Pokemon Go about 4 years too early, where players captured procedurally-placed charaters (either the Washigton State Convention Center or the Ballard district of Seattle) within a story-driven game. 


## Slalom Consulting – Seattle, WA				Consultant, National Mobility Team

May 2010-2012

I joined Slalom as a mobile engineer focused on iPhone, bringing my enterprise experience along and enabling growth for clients. I had some unique experience on Windows CE ("wince"!) and with driver development that put me on a few esoteric projects, but most of our pipeline was there to help clients with "digital transformation" to a mobile-first world, so most of our work was on iOS–Android adoption was not there yet. I moved to leadership toward the end and was offered a practice lead position, which I had to decline to follow my heart to Artifact and the challenge of bringing interesting mobile experiences to live music venues.

- Software engineering and technical consultation for multiple clients.
- Technical resource throughout project planning, from finalizing the SOW to release management.
- Projects were often solo, delivered on iPhone, iPad, Windows Phone 7, Windows CE (eek) and Blackberry (double eek) in the Enterprise. 
- Recognized as company MVP - an award given quarterly to 2 or 3 out of over 1000 employees across the US. 

## Listen Faster – Seattle, WA					Owner

June 2006-2009

From momentum created with some of my music- and art-related consulting, I gained an anchor client focused on music delivery and founded a small consultancy. This was at an inflection point for mobile, when the iPhone was first released but bandwidth was not yet ubiquitous to support a streaming music model (yet). I advised any artist I could share my skills with, and as a result got involved in a few fairly visible installation exhibits with unique technical problems to solve. 

- Software engineering consultation for mobile, web and desktop applications.
- Designed and delivered a web application and driver stack to deliver protected (WMDRM) music content to connected mp3 players through Internet Explorer, WDM. This was intended to compete with Spotify before it hit the US market.
- Developed interactive exhibits utilizing proprietary software involving image processing and motion tracking in dark spaces filled with the artist's unique laser projections
- Developed proprietary audio pattern recognition & audio generation.
- Rebuilt the particpant tracking and audio streaming backend for Roundware, a location-based platform for engaging with visitors to outdoor exhibits. Built with support by the Smithsonian Insitute and deployed in several contexts at the Mall in DC (roundware.org)

## Adapx – Seattle, WA					Senior Software Developer

July 2006 – July 2008.

Adapx grew out of a DARPA-funded research effort from OSHU (Oregon Science and Health University). We developed priorietary multi-modal solutions, where handwriting, speech and gesture recognition are used in concert to increase accuracy. One result was developing milspec digital pens, which sample digital ink while writng actual ink on physical paper. 

- Architected and implemented Capturx Forms for Excel (a bridge from a Digital Pen to Excel)
- Development lead on Capturx for One Note (a bridge from a Digital Pen to MS OneNote)
- Product lead on Formx (a form processing engine leveraging Digital Pen & Paper)
- Co-author on two patents related to digitization of paper-based workflows.
- Developed field-tested map solution for DoD using proprietary military symbology and handwriting recognition frameworks developed by our research team members. Participated in military deployment exercises.

## Irdeto Mobile (formerly Lockstream) – Seattle, WA	Senior Software Developer

January 2001 – July 2006

Lockstream began as a platform for releasing digital albums, funded by members of Devo and Floyd Rose among others. We pivoted to a digital rights managment platform, partnering with Motorola, NEC, Nokia and others to protected digital media delivered to 'feature phones' in the time before iPhone hit. I was extensively involved in implementing driver stacks, kernel level code and protocol implementations for different handset manufacturers.  


- Lead integration engineer for all mobile platforms, built QA team of 3. 
- Lead developer on OMA 2.0 DRM Server implementation.
- Mentored & trained staff on new technologies, conducted salary reviews.
- On-site company technical representative to overseas integration clients including NEC and Motorola. I had a desk full of developer boards and test ahead of hardware releases.

## Sunhawk - Software Engineer, Lead Music Editor

January 1998-January 2001

Sunhawk was a digital sheet music platform in the early days of the internet. We had our own music layout engine and software, which we used to typeset print material and bring it online, which was in demand in those days. We worked as copyists, arrangers and digital publishers for EMI, Warner Brothers and many others. This was my first position as a programmer out of school, which seemed taylored to my studies in computer science and signal processing while pursuing my music degrees.

- Built elaborate manual test strategy for hybrid team located in Seattle, WA and Chelyabinsk, Russia.
- Delivered 3 month onsite training for editors and engineers in Chelyabinsk.
- Implemented feature set to synchronize visual and audio playback of sheet music.
- Music engraving and layout editing to align with house style for clients.
