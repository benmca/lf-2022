[Max Hattler](http://www.maxhattler.com/) is unique and awesome.

"1925 aka Hell is one of two animation loops directed by Max Hattler, inspired by the work of French outsider artist Augustin Lesage (1876-1954). 1925 is based on Lesage's painting A Symbolic Composition of the Spiritual World from 1925, below. The second loop, 1923 aka Heaven, is based on Lesage's painting of the same name from 1923. The films were created during 5 days in February 2010 with students at The Animation Workshop in Viborg, Denmark."
