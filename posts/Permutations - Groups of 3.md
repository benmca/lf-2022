Permutations can pull complexity out of simple exercises

Take a simple G major scale:
![Permutations1](/main/img/Permutations1.png)

Using alternate picking, alternate the notes in the scale you play with the root, like so:
![Permutations2](/main/img/Permutations2.png)

Challenging string skipping, right? With practice, you'll start to find you right hand will grow accustomed to the distance between the strings. Playing this with alternate picking, you'll always play the changing note on either an up or down stroke. 

We can tweak this exercise simply and make it more challenging. Maintaining alternate picking, try playing the root twice as you alternate the notes in the scale, like so:
![Permutations5](/main/img/Permutations5.png)

What's different? Do you notice the alternation in picking that happens in the notes that are circled below? The picking direction alternates, throwing your right hand off initially.  Once you have practiced this slowly, you'll notice your right hand 'remembers' the distance between the sixth string and the others.  

This exercise is always part of my warmup routine. Trying playing this on one guitar, then switching to another. Do you notice a difference in the string spacing between the two instruments? Switch between a nylon-string classical guitar and a Strat for an obvious example.
