As clear as yesterday's first light, I remember hearing that my sister was FINALLY born one December night while my brother and I stayed with family friends. "You're sister's finally here!" I had heard my parents talking about potential names, and somehow "Jennifer Lee McAllister" is the one I understood to be a keeper, so much so that I'd spread the word at school. "When's Jennifer coming?" "Has your mom had Jennifer yet?" etc.

I was so excited, I hadn't caught that the plan had changed. My dad came by late with cigars (is that still a thing?) to let us know she was finally here, and I had to sheepishly go back to school the next morning and let me teacher know that the "welcome Jennifer" signs we'd made for me to take home needed updating to Gretchen. In lieu of cigars, we third graders passed around jelly beans to celebrate.

My sister Gretch was born today!  

Meanwhile - I'm getting ready for the Medicine Hat show next month. The harmonics on [Monkey](https://listenfastermusic.bandcamp.com/track/monkey) need some cleanin up, but man do I love playing this part.
