I've been listening to shortwave through on [online sdr](http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/) after [reading about Alan Roe's guide to music on shortwave](https://swling.com/blog/2025/01/alan-roes-b-24-season-guide-to-music-on-shortwave-version-3-0/), and found some beautiful bits. 

Dammmmmmmmmn.  This is a broadcast from Korea according to the guide. Korean gutbucket groove. Really ends up heavy. I love this.

Oh yeah, I was happy to receive the new versions of the Tri-Axium writings today. I posted in a few spots online and actually got some responses from people, as well as a few interestedin reading about Braxton more.
