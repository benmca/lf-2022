A short one today, created on a plane in 2018. My head has been immersed in computer-generated sounds past and present. I had a job where I spent a lot of time in airports and on planes, and there is (believe it or not) something special about being able to create compositions out of raw thought (and code) in these sterile, usually personality-free spaces. The places of free of character, which of course highlights the parade of humanity you see - making noise while people-watching is the best. This is a doctored still from one of many timelapses I've taken from the exit row.
