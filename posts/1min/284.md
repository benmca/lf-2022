It's been a week of Covid after 2 weeks of housework, and today I finally have a music nest set up in our new Olalla house. Basic but done. I was all despondent last night after seeing too many successful outsiders online and those self-destructive I-should-hang-it-up demons were out in full force. I freeplayed on my SG for a while to clear my head and this line started coming out, which seems like a child's song of hyper spasmotic joyâ€“just the 'beginner's mind' mindset I try to cultivate.
