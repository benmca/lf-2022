Medicine Hat is reconvening for practices and an EP, and we're in songwriting mode for the first time in 30 years. I put this together yesterday. A random guy burst into our practice space one night in 1991, like a seal through the surface of the water, and shouted "Bates I knew I'd find you!" at our singer Sean (Bates).  These things stick in your head and you refer to them every time you see each other.
