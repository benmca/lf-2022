Went to my space yesterday looking for other versions of the Christmas Ball song, and I found this arrangement I did for  Gerald Kechley's Orchestration class at UW back in 1998 or so. Some clunkers, but I think I reused the counterline in the second vibraphone part for Bizzy Bizzy. This is all canned sounds from Ableton.
