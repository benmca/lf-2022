Learned a bit about sample slicing and dicing in TidalCycles, using ebow and gtr samples I've been playing with in Csound/Thuja forever. There's a different feel between this and Thuja - everything aligning on a cycle feels like a constraint I want to work around sooner rather than later, so it'll be [learning to string patterns](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/composition) together for longer ideas next.
