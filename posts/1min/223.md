Set my recorder out to catch some coyotes, but caught this distant singing. Something coming out of someone's distant system as the party's winding down (this was around 1am last night) or something more ritualistic? Hearing it from a distance, along side wind and chirping insects adds its own filter that no machine can duplicate. I strip all the noise down and boost the signal of the voices so you can hear them more clearly in the second half. Cydney tells me Joe will know this song.
