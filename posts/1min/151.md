Psyched to get into shortwave recording this weekend over at the Olalla place, now that chores are lightening up. This was recorded September 20, 2023, when I first got this new [rtl-sdr](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/) setup and ran the shortwave through my laptop with [gqrx](https://www.gqrx.dk/). Nerds!Nerds!Nerds!Nerds! 

This pic is from 10 years ago to the day, with my fair bride at the Getty Institute, lookin real cool. What should the band be called? Fresh and Easy?
