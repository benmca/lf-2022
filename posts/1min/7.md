I bought for of these boomboxes about 20 years ago to do a piece at the Moore called From Mixdown, where I played four different cds I assembled, manually synced. I dusted off the one I still possess, and brought it home to do some tape pause stuff - always a thing that breaks writers block for me. Here's what I put together from the FM dial this afternoon at 430.
