I was feeling there there wasn't enough whammy bar up in this joint so here we go. Michael Hedges, Steve Vai and Adrian Belew were the ones who really opened my 80s teenage ear to the possibilities of the whammy bar, but I didn't like the rock ornaments as much as I did the unique way you could turn a single pitch into a line with this device. It wasn't until I heard music played on the Vietnamese Dan Bau that I heard something I really wanted to emulate. Not that this is in that style but I do like that this is just hammer-ons and pull-offs, with most of the rhythmic work being done with the bar.
