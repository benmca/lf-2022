So many shortwave tapes made on the San Juans. One time (on Jan 17, 2009) we went to a Lopez house Mike and Anna had rented for a family getaway. graciously including Leesa and I. Gracie and I were hanging out in the beautful backyard, and I recorded these bits. Some signals and something in German - I'll have to get Sven's help to translate. Being on the San Juans always feels like you have left Seattle and are on the edge of the frontier, the open sea, and the radio waves you catch only emphasize this.
