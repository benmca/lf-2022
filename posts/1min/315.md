Is it already time to go home??? Here's one of 20 pics of me with this Dyer. 

The last night before I left Racine, I pulled out a radio and did some tape pause compositions. Racine is just an hour north of Chicago on Lake Michigan, and I pulled in some nice things to cut up. This cut-up technique yields some really nice byproducts to my ear, like the guitar and bassline I'm trying to sift from the noisy AM radio drift.
