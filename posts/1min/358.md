The influx of friends and family is about to begin, and it's time to put all my fancy plans and thoughts aside and be present. This blog is just about to wrap it's first year. When it's come up in conversation with people, I get the question "Why?" in a few different forms. 

What's the goal?
What's do you want the world to perceive?

I'm mulling over this a bunch this week, as the hours fill up with reconnecting. This time of year, also, I think I'm always pulling out old notebooks and listening to old ideas in my head, sometimes making them audible. I mentioned [a site with all these different AI models to separate recordings into stems](https://mvsep.com), and I used it to pull the laughter and crowd noise out of recording of an old orchestral piece of mine, Bizzy Bizzy. I used the player's mumuring voices in one section, where they read the same piece of text in a low voice. Cool to hear it separated.
