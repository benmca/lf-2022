This one's goin out to the Priz - [Wizard Prison flavor](https://wizardprison.bandcamp.com/) here from some time in 2018. That's the sound of the [DL-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_6_DL4) doing it's best Space Echo impression. More good clangy seconds - I love the sound of seconds on my SG.  

A picture of Paul Simon's capo, from a new doc on him we watched last night. I was moved. Paul always makes the words flow for me: 


People keep asking<br/>
“how much is enough” <br/>
I tell them as a man but <br/>
the dynamics make it tough.<br/> 
What once was elemental <br/>
now comes out in a stream, and days of <br/>
compromise and <br/>
gentle talk <br/>
sound like <br/>
a distant dream. <br/>
