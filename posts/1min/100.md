Stereolab on the brain, a little sketch from 4 years ago I've been calling "Stereo Style" in my notebooks. The out-of-tune piano is the last gasp of my upright before I gave it to a happy person via Craigslist free.

Went to Sten and Nete's last night for a long overdue catchup, and I snapped this picture of a guitar of his I've been coveting for a long time, a Hikari Parlor Guitar.  Beautiful little instrument with a very slender profile - not the usual OM shape. Hubba hubba.
