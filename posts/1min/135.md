Score is in my last folder - the beginning of a Guitar Cult piece not yet realized. Trying to maximize what I can get from consistent glissandos on an electric. For 6 guitars if I remember correctly.

Washing the big slider left really angular water patterns on the panes. I tried to capture - seemed like notation at the time, but hard to get the phone to focus on it.
