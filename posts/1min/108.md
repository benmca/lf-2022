Short one today. I made this little study for the op-1, so I could learn how to do these polyrhythms and get a god texture. A good god texture. It's more sound cloud than I thought it would be - the last bit really works. I made the quintuplets by upping the varispeed and playing with the Endless sequencer, but forgot about correcting the pitch, so listen to the rhythms, not the pitches. Everything is recorded at 120 bpm except the quints, which were recorded at 150bpm, so they're off a bit.

I'm going to see Oneohtrix Point Never tonight, and I'm psyched to see how he performs his record Again. No idea what to expect.
