I'll remember this sketch because the demo here sounds like it did in my head. We saw an electrical storm like no other from Korƒçula, looking east to Dubrovnik. There were intense rains that day, but by night we were oceanside at our Potirna Air Bnb under a moderate breeze, watching 3 parallel lightning shows duke it out.
