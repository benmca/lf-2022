Old Notebooks 2: This is another [Shag Carpet](https://www.listenfaster.com/main/shag-carpet/) cue. Mike asked me the other night 'what happens when Neil (Wilson, drumming friend on many projects) just goes for it and tears it up', rock-wise. This was the first time I got that on tape I think, way back in 2002 or so. Real dry drums in that basement of his. I dig those low horns, which I think are all Greg Sinibaldi.
