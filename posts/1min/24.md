Been forever since a practice, it seems. Jason, Neil and I got together tonight to turn a corner in the project with no name. Here are some potential names we've added to our list:

Giza

Dream conduit

Sweet emulsion

Denying the existence of boxes 

Bad actors 

Cathode ray

Super shock control

Breakfast terrorists

Spider making house 

New variants 

Benji

I brought this in from a post [a few days ago](/main/1min/22/) and we messed with it a bit tonight. Who doesn't like a cop show?
