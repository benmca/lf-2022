King Crimson tunes with Steve Vai and Adrian Belew, Danny Carey from Tool and Tony Levin. My god what chops. Great to see Dave Verkade and Levi Fuller there, along with Jason, Preston and brother Matt. Yes, Vai sells autographed practice amps at the merch table! Listen to Belew go in this solo snip - WOW.
