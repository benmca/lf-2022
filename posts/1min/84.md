I was doing meditative repetitive labor all weekend, and had a new recording of some of Ligeti's work by the Ensemble Intercontemporain rolling. It had me reflecting on my love of Ligeti, Varese, Xenakis, and the many ways I've tried to do big orchestral sound objects with my 4 track, my computer, or my multi-guitar writing, so here's a bit. 

Went to go see Mike and Diana's new band Cadual Penduncle last night, and was already sleepy by 9. Man I'm ready for this move to be over. Live music makes me so happy when the players are having a blast, like here in this pic - so shiny!
