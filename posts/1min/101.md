Can't remember where this sketch was, but it evoked a trudge across the tundra to me and was one of the first things to inspire me to write the Tuktu material. I remember going nuts from too much office work downtown and went to the music floor of the library downtown - the kick ass Rem Koolhaus building we have in Seattle. There was a practice room with piano which I could lock myself in for an hour, and I made this interlocking clapping rhythm there. Clapping the pulses is always a way to break the writer's block for me.  

This is a still from our second Tuktu promo.  Walking across the beach on San Juan Island, I color-balanced my bare footprints in the sand to evoke a barefoot tundra-walk, like [Atanarjuat](https://www.isuma.tv/atanarjuat) in The Fast Runner.
