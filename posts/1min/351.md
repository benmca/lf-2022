Here's take of the Christmas Ball Melody that appeared at the end of my piece for Degenerate Art Orchestra's one show. You'll hear Neil pull the string that starts the melody from the actual ball, then the orchestral arrangement I did kicks in. I can't believe that this little music box is still functioning, and not beat to hell.  

I title this piece *Bizzy Bizzy* originally, for the theme that reminded me of working on something super-repetitive, maybe in a factory. Factory worker music. This ending was the sweet release the worker felt at the end of the day, after they'd fallen asleep. More on the piece in coming posts.  The score for this is lost to the sands of time, but here's a sketch and bunch of notes that I, at least, can map to the final product.
