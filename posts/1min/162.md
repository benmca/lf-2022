Here I am without the guitar, without the connection my hands make to my strings vibrating into air absorbed by the earth, connected to my vibrato, making a single point sustain and sing, connected to my patterns jumping from string to string, connecting my lines to make shapes that make my sounds, connecting my bleached and muddy harmonies, my icy and gummy and firey blobs, pulling two notes together, beating to make a third. My brain isn't up to it tonight, I need to use my hands, but I can't without the guitar.
