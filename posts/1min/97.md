It's been so busy with the house that I haven't practiced or written much this past week, though I did post [one thing last week](https://www.listenfaster.com/main/86/) that Jason turned into this. Sweet beginnings to another hit. I can't place the vibes of the mallet percussion here but man is it familiar.
