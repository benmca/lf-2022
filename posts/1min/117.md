Up on Lopez, Kim, Leesa and I saw two hawks and two eagles in some sort of fight - the hawks had a seagull-like call that I managed to catch a few times at the beginning here, but the eagles were silent. They each were clearly pairs - I even saw the eagles tap wingtips as they flew, like they were high-fiving. Not sure what they were chasing but I'm assumed it was food, given the competition.
