Reunited with brother Robert and so many friends at John and Susan's tonight. Momentum for the C'mon C'mon reunion and second record is once again building thanks to this lovely man hitting town. So grateful for such good friends. 

There was a gig for the [Degenerates](https://degenerateartensemble.com) at Sandpoint and there were a bunch of other things on the bill. Sometime in 2003. Somehow I raised my hand to prepare background sounds for a group of Kung Fu practicioners (is that a troupe?) to demonstrate to. I had Bobby improvise some vibes on my DAT recorder (old days) and I pulled them into my studio and overdubbed. I don't have the masters or mixes anymore, but it sounded something like this.
