From [March 8](https://www.listenfaster.com/main/68/):

This pattern was written on night 2 with no sleep 11 years ago almost to the day, about 3am (my orig recording is Memo 2013.03.01-EndlessLoopTuktu.mp3). Creating something angular that sits in one position and can be looped.

Voivod show last night was amazing. Got to meet Away briefly and talk to Dan Mongrain (Chewy) for a bit. They both thought they'd met me before, and I think I did meet Away when they played the Offramp for Outer Limits. Maybe social media? Could hardly sleep. Now the weekend in Olalla, with a new improved battery for field recording.
