Damn I am glad I took the time to learn how to export these. I spent a chunk of time tonight learning how to get these EP133 bits cleanly into Ableton - thank you Son Wu for your [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKA0oGv4jUE). I love the basslines I make on this thing, and can't replicate it in Ableton yet.. or on anything else.  Lots of bookkeeping today after an angsty night, feeling like I've left my composer-self behind, adrift in Seattle's ether somewhere. I gotta book a solo show and get some ep action happening.
