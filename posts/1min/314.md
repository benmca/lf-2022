Every day we start with some incredible coffee from John's La Pavoni, and continue talking music until 12 or 1 am. I am smiling ear-to-ear in most of the pictures I took, here I was trying to look 'serious'. 

More harp guitar noodles here. I want one badly now. My brain is starting to wrap itself around the bass tuning and drive lines upward. I wrote in my notebook that it extended my reach - given the time I imagine I'd be making them the axes on some extended angular lines like slider rays, once I can wrap my right hand around jumping between courses.
