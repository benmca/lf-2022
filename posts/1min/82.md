First day on a real ride in awhile, listening to the mixes I think are approaching 'finished' for a solo record. This is the shortest one, whose working title is *Descending Glitch Mandala*, speaking of Mandalas like I was yesterday. These all work well to my ear on repeated listenings - maybe you will like them too? Should I care?

On my rides to downtown from Ballard I dig seeing the new glyphs on the trail - this one appeared in three forms today, each one 'saying' a different thing - this one's saying Basketball, another one Football, and a third one either Sphicter or Sun, it's hard to tell in this style.
