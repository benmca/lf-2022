One strategy I use to get unstuck is to bust out Slonimsky's [*Thesaurus Of Scales And Melodic Patterns*](https://archive.org/details/nicolasslonimskythesaurusofscalesandmelodicpatterns), pick a random scale/pattern, and do something with it. Here I grabbed a few of the scales used in Gamelan music and played with sequencing and harmonizing them.  The sound-world, the vibe that comes with just sitting and soaking in this tonality is really special to my ears.  I think this one is called "Selisir" - you can see some thoughts on a Guitar Cult piece on this notebook page.
