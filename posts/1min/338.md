Leesa Likes the owl sounds much better than the coyotes. It's been very still at night, the valley socked in with fog. Your eyes think that the sound will be dead in somehow, but it actually acts as a sort of filter and I got really clean recordings of some nearby owls, clean of most of the background noise I've been getting off the road below. They have a little chuckle or cluck they do at the end that I listen for; if I hear that, I think I've got a nearby owl. This is recording is 100% owls.

We finally unloaded the pod today, officially moved. Living legally at long last.
