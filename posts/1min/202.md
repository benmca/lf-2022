So [32 sounds](https://32sounds.com/) was real thought-provoking. I am so fortunate to have this ear, this practice and developing abilities. I get sheepish and weirded out sometimes with how far out I think my sound making is, then I watch 80-year-old [Annea Lockwood](https://www.annealockwood.com/) listening to a river bed with her hydrophones and know I'm on the right path. This mix is on top of an old loop and bass line from 2011 or so ("Some Shakers"), with some shortwave vocals from India flown in over the top.
