A little bit of wisdom. I'm not sure who this is from on this episode of Meet the Composer. He drops some knowledge about how composing is a way of being honest with yourself, and ultimately a way to optimize yourself. I think about this quote a lot - especially in a week where I am not the best version of myself.

Ryan's new amazing tatoo is pictured here. I assumed it was graphic (musical) notation. It wasn't, but it did give me an excuse to tell him about [Ligeti's Artikulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71hNl_skTZQ) and [Cornelius Cardew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0V9_xqaw8Q) for a minute. I can't wait to get my books back out of storage and have [Notations 21](https://www.themarginalian.org/2011/05/06/notations-21/) handy again. Nerd alert. I will sonify this diagram soon.
