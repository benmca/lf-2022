One time in the summer of 2015, deep in the woods up the Teanaway River, I caught this weird loop at 15190kHz. At the time my friend Matt and I were going to use it as the base for a tune in our Gamma Male project but it was lost to the sands of time, mainly because I am sooooo late to the party in learning how to clean these recordings up with Audition. Better late than never. A little tweaking / remixing what I recorded, and some subtle drums beneath.
