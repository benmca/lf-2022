Can't remember what I was thinking or what arrangement I heard off this little sketch, except for the note on Woe is a Me Bop - I want drumming that sounds like John French on that tune. This pulse will have to suffice. I'll post it now though I don't like it - maybe it'll sound different tomorrow.
