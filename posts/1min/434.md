Working with John and Neil on Guitar Cult today. I have a study or two to do to really nail this idea down from the middle of Square. It's a weird thing when you pull the drums out, and those hocketing exchanges between the guitars are still a little sloppyâ€“they only work when the players are metronomic, otherwise there's a little bit of swing. Do I like that? Is that a cool quirk?
