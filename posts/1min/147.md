Last Friday night the woods in Olalla sounded like Pasadena, where there are constant mockingbirds (and many others) going intermittently all night. Maybe because it was suddenly so warm? Lots of birdies. It reminded me of the opening to skylarking. I opened up TidalCycles for the first time in months and played with some samples from the audio I took.
