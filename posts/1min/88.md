The shortwave reception is amazing from our Olalla spot - we're up relatively high and have nothing nearby that would create interference. I didn't manage to make my overnight recordings this week, so no Coyotes to share, but I did catch a bunch of Chinese shortwave with only an extension cord for an antenna. Next weekend I'll bring the powered loop. 

I used to hear this station (9720 kHz - China National Radio) from our backyard in Ballard, when we just had a little horse stable on the back corner. I always pictured it playing in a factory or workshop of some sort, the relentless pulse pushing fingers to activity. I did a little cleanup and used Live to pull some of the melodic elements out. 

The sky has so little light pollution I managed to get stars from the iPhone's camera.
