We passed inspection and did a weekend of back-rending chores. Poor Mikey caught the worst of it. Lots of chill fall air out there, with beautiful clear nights - I've scored this scene many times, like this bit from Urban Scarecrow, Andy's 2nd film. I think that's Tom Swafford on violin? Hi Tom, if you're out there!
