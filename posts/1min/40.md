I've been collecting shortwave sounds for decades and they pop up here and there in my work. This track played on the PA before my band Tuktu hit the stage and can be heard on a few of the promo videos we made ([like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k8A7r643Bo)).  I am feeling the pull to do more with these filtered sw sounds and am psyched to be moving out of the city, where I'll def get cleaner reception.
