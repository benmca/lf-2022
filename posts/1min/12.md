Something went wrong with my equipment and I only caught 7-11pm last night, which is not where the magic typically is happening.  This is especially the case on a semi-blustery night - I'd hoped for sound-absorbing snowfall to hit, and for me to catch a very clean dawn chorus in Olalla, but alas this is it.  It's minimal, but with a spectral diagram of the sound you can still visually pick out a few things.  I'm using Adobe Audition here.

In the screenshot you seen three main sounds in this minute of sound: bugs chirping (faint purple), the repeating squeak of a windmill in the valley below, and gusts of wind hitting nearby trees. Pretty minimalist this time around, but I'll find a few more to annotatae this week.
