I was reading about poster art the other day and there was this comment, which I'll paraphrase thusly: "people want a lot elements in an image, and space to allow them to draw their own conclusion".  Sometimes I find random bits like this and, having no recollection where, when, what, who created the sounds, fill in the gaps. This was just called "Vox.wav" in a folder dated 11.28.2023. This pic drawn by Ella a few days before, on the 23rd.
