Right at the beginning of lockdown in 2020 I had many nights where I stopped caring about what anybody thought of anything and just recorded what I heard in my head. My cousin Kevin called it "shaving my life" - removing the bullshit that gets in the way of creation. I'm always trying to cultivate that but man: you get caught up trying to get people to come to a show, or convince someone that your outside music will bring an audience, and you're thinking more about marketing than music. So Covid was a great solidifier for me in deciding not to think like that ever, for the rest of my life. This little minute is saying "dayum it!!!" then "hey we're gonna get through this".
