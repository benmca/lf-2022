New Fred Frith came today - Reissue of the first *Guitar Solos* plus new album *Fifty*. I tuned the Danelectro randomly and decided to follow Fred's advice:

```

“Improvised structures – the perception that they mostly consist of “boring” bits that lead to “exciting” bits; but if you attempt to cut out the boring bits by making very short “exciting” pieces, the result is the creation of stereotypes, self-conscious attempts to exite, predictable ways of manipulating the audience...easy to fall into 
traps, but better to resist simplistic definitions in the first place. Learning to empty yourself before playing.”

```

Finally going to see *Poor Things* tonight.
