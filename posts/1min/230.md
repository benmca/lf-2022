From [Feb 18](https://www.listenfaster.com/main/49/): Brainstorming parts to a tune Jason set up with the working title of loss, my hands we not warming up, so I rabbit-holed on this. This is one of 4 studies I wrote during a Satori moment in Boonville in 2006. For me, these pieces ground me and present new challenges whenever I pick at them. Today I decided to play with a straight boom-kat and not take any repeats. It induces a brain fog while I'm playing that I need to breathe to break through, so ultimately its kind of a breathing exercise.
