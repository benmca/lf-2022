I've been listening to shortwave through on [online sdr](http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/) after [reading about Alan Roe's guide to music on shortwave](https://swling.com/blog/2025/01/alan-roes-b-24-season-guide-to-music-on-shortwave-version-3-0/), and found some beautiful bits. 

A little remix of some more All India Radio. 

I put some new rock pickups in my G+L strat for Medicine Hat practices, which commence today for our show on the 18th.
