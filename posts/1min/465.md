Morel season is almost here.  We went to hear Mike Beug talk at the PSMS meeting last night. Seeing how he finds the energy to go out every week, forage like crazy, discover new species, and push his updates to iNaturalist, it's super inspiring for me. Lees said "he's like you" in this constant seeker, constant student way, which is a very sweet thing to say to my ego.
