While in Croatia this month, I was digging through some old tapes and found a recording of Radio Bulgaria I made from 2006. 

Not sure what happened here - they started playing a traditional tune, then kicked into this hold-music funk. I'm digging the solo sections - terrible and tight ending! 


Pictured are some paste-ups from this week in Zagreb.
