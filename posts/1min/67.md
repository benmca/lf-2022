This popped on on the drive home from Edmonds last night. Such a big sound from a little buddy - love me some [PO-35](https://teenage.engineering/guides/po-35/en) - everyone should have one. It's often the best metronome too.  Heading to see Voivod tonight at El Corazon so getting this one in quick before the workday begins.
