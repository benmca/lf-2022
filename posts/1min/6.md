Bobby and Ryan came over tonight and we did a variation on a piece I did at the Chapel a while ago, where I recorded the audience singing some notes - humming, singing 'eeeeee' and 'oooooo'.  I took these and worked some computer magic on them to evoke a choir. I'm super zoned out from coding this thing up all day today - made big improvements to my [Thuja](https://github.com/benmca/thuja) workflow along the way. Big laughs all around - I _had_ to include a tiny bit at the end. Lees, Ryan and Bobby were pros, as you can hear at the end.
