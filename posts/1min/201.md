What is this? Something called "Piano Solo 6" from 15 years ago, recorded in the Fremont space. I recorded 7 of these that seemed worthy of saving at the time. This is probably right when I got the space, around 2006. Trying to not think and just play. Overlayed some rhythm machine recording (can't remember which device it was but it is collectible, I think it was Sean's). 

Today's chore was this beautiful wallpaper. Now I'm going to watch ["32 sounds"](https://32sounds.com/).
