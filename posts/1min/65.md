Laying it on with the SK-1 and the TE toys, aaaaaand I spent my lunch break at the piano. A quadruple timed guitar solo seemed necessary. I've been listening to Squarepusher's new one a ton (Dostrotime) and tried to ape a guitar solo thing he's done really beautifully on Holoform - mine sounds super primitive but that's what happened in the moment.
