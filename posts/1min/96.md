This weekend's biophony: three selections from 10 hours of recording. It was a quiet night, though there is the first instance of some mechanical buzzing I hadn't heard - insect or just something nearby buzzing? Last night we heard a scrap between two animals - not sure what but I'm glad I wasn't outside next to them, though they could be cats I would expect to hear more low rowring like I do in housecats. That's the first sound, then some distant coyotes, then the first appearance of an owl - several different ones if I listen over the course of the night. These one or two seemed to be in communication - you can hear them together for 2 calls, then separate.
