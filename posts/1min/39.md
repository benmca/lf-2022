More writing in a constrained space - this time I'm at an airport with only the phone, and I'm using a weird and cool little sequencing program called [Nanoloop](https://nanoloop.com/).  It was originally a cartridge for the Ninetendo Gameboy, and the author rewrote it for the iPhone and Android. A real unique piece of software design, and another sitch like i said yesterday: different tools cause me to play differently. I was not sure I could come up with anything interesting but I think the crosstalk of the 4 (or more) parts at the end of this clip work.
