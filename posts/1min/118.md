Flip on KSQM ("K-Sequim") 91.5 FM and you'll hear a a clutch of *very* local NW DJs, though none as unique as this quirky goofball: "The Unknown DJ". I'm not sure if he's trying to emulate Snagglepuss or Christopher Walken or what, but these are the most roundabout intros to songs you will ever hear. I'm not sure how long he's going to last so I had to capture him and share.
