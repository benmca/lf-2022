Each guitar I have is it's own being, it's own personality, a unique machine. I play differently on each one. I have an 80s Ibanez 540s, a total shredder guitar, and with a chorus, I was surprised to find I am channeling Jamie West-Oram from the Fixx, whose playing I love. Great times tonight with Neil and Jason.
