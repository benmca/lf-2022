I tried to do the pvoc trick with the coyotes, but it wasn't as fun to listen to as this. A way to approach remixing beats maybe - I trigger the same ultra-filtered sample multiple time, and the result is some interesting crosstalk between the rhythms in the different samples. That probably won't make sense to anyone but me, but dang it sounds cool enough I think.  [Here's the original](https://www.listenfaster.com/main/39/) before any filtering.
