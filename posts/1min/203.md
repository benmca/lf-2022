Saw David Russell (Doctor!) the other night after way too many days, and man I miss writing tunes like this! Cmon cmon was a good one, and we're at least planning on remixing the second record. This and many other demos are fodder for extras. I think that's DR on backups? I know he pushed me to write the best lines here, if they weren't his to begin with. "We need some 'notice me' rhymes."
