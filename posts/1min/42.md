Like I said yesterday, Saturday we trawled through some Medicine Hat archives ([see yesterday's post](https://listenfaster.com/main/1min/41/)) and the sounds we found on the latests tape have been in my head all weekend.  In this one I hear a clear nod to Drive Like Jehu and a sweet slide riff I am going to dust off and do something with. Bass player Scott had a lot of new-fangled gadgets, including a subwoofer, a looper and a sampler (maybe the same piece of equipment), which is put to good use in the opening. Sean's melody absolutely rules.
