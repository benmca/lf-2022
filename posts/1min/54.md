Here's another spectrogram from these crazy seal / sea lion vocalizations I recorded on Lopez the other night.  I did a little experiment in Audition and Photoshop to link the spectrograms, so you can see the sound patterns.  Check out the upper frequencies at about 5 seconds in - I put a marker in the sound file calling this voice "the kid", since it's one of the only individuals standing out with anything > 1k.
