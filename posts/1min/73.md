Still messing with this angular pattern. A pulse ties these patterns together - it was the last thing I laid down. Fun and weird thing to play, this endless loop thing idea - the hammers on the string and the pinky-barre.. it's a real pinky workout unless I hold the guitar high, like right next to my face.
