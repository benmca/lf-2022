As summer fades to fall and our move to Olalla starts to solidify, I find I'm managing my time in weeks instead of days. I have a background thread of music running constantly, but time in the "studio" I've built over here is second to my trying to keep my guitar chops fresh (1-2 hours/day) which is also second, of course, to getting our house set up. I'm updating these next two weeks looking back from 11/4.  A little riffing with a shortwave recording I made "20240826-am radio hindi prayer" - I of course have no idea if this is a prayer or not.
