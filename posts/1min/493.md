Well this seems entirely too long, but whatevs. Piano Solo 6 from an old notebook pre-2012. This was real slow on the initial demo but it feels different at 92 - was at 60. Man that piano I had was incapable of holding tune, but I LOVED it regardless. I found the worst string at the end there. Here's a picture of it's soundboard, and notation for today's bit. ![](/main/img/default-bg.jpg)
