Something going on here with the bass line. We've been quoting Jimi Hendrix alot lately from Foxey Lady: "Here I come baby, I'm comin to GITcha!", at funtimes.  We have an apple tree now, and I love to pick apples, so whenever I walk up to the apple tree, I say out loud, "here I come apples, I'm comin to GITcha!" That kind of thing. These are the jokes that cracka me up.
