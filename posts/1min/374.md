Getting ready for our second Medicine Hat show in the last 30 years, joining Chimestone once again at the Royal Room on January 18th. We may learn a new tune - I've been working on transcribing that all day, but the demo is too boring to post. I need to decorate it some more - maybe tomorrow.

So this 'new' tune is captured from audio captured by my brother's (I think?) video camera, and it's distorted as all get out. There's a third tune on there I never posted because it was toooooo long but maybe this little bit will grow on me like the other ones did. 

Oh the photo: one time we were on the news for playing in Des Moines WA, not IA.
