"Arkansas Traveler" is a traditional fiddle tune that I first heard electrified on a compilation of Speedy West and Jimmy Bryant's called *Stratosphere Boogie*.  My god did I love this record - I played it incessantly and absorbed the sounds throughout high school, but  didn't think myself capable of playing any of it until later. Jimmy Bryant's technique is so amazing - he burns through this - but don't let that dissuade you like it did me!  It's great at any speed, and such a blast to warm up with. I need to transcribe more of these. 

(Here's their version):

I think I play it with a pretty weird fingering - I found an old notebook with my original 20-year-old scratch and recopied it for posterity here.
