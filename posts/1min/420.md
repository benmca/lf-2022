2021.03.26.Slidey Idea mix.  This study focuses on a thing we spent a lot of time on in rehearsal, the problem of finding the pocket in these tight interlocking things. If you listen to each part, you'll hear rhythmically precise slides and mutes. 2 notes, but 5 actions: mute string, pick, slide, mute string, change position. Getting these parts right in isolation is one problem, the next is to get it right when listening to the other, complimentary line. If you know my work you'll know it's part of my schtick as a composer, one of my moves, and I make these little demos to give me a sense of the challenge in finding the pocket in a given section. 

Pictured: A Framus 12-string guitar found at an antique shop in Bisbee.  Framus was a word my dad used (uses still?) to descibe any contraption generically, like a weird pronoun. He has a few of these. Ferndoc, for example, refers to any part of the body.
