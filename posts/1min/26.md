I was a total TV kid and seem to have retained all the theme songs and jingles I've heard in the 70s and 80s.  Things like this are often the result. The name "Buds Crystal Radio" popped into my head, recalling an episode of Flipper where lost kid Bud (IIRC) uses his newly built crystal radio to signal his location.
