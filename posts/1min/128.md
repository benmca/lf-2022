Morels bring flavor to any pile of garbage - check out this biggie.  A remix here of an improv on Skips - notebook says "Improv 3 Rainy Rock".  It is blustery as hell today in spots, heading over the Narrows bridge, especially.  Ableton warping magic really works when you play with a lot of percussion. I love the sound of beating seconds on my SG.
