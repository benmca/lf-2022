Skips is a real special piece for me. Stravinsky said, about writing the Rite of Spring, "I was the vessel the Rite passed through", or something close. He opened up and it channelled through. I had a similar experience one time at my space. Very warmed up, I sat and started playing a stream of low G sixteenth notes. My hands started wandering around like I was using a Ouija board, and soon I generated this. I felt more like a listener than a player.
