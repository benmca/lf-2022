This is yet another GC sketch, derived from Skips. Skips is a real special piece for me. Stravinsky said one time, about writing the Rite of Spring, "I was the vessel the Rite passed through", or something close.

 one too derives from the middle section of Skips ([here's a solo version](https://soundcloud.com/listenfaster/skips-solo-mix-tempo92)) and is intended to be a second or third movement to the piece.
