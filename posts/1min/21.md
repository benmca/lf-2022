Fred Frith said a thing in the new issue of the [Wire magazine](https://www.thewire.co.uk/issues/479/480): If an improviser is thinking about form while they're improvising, chances are the form is going to be extremely banal. You need to let the form take care of itself, and then you'll have an interesting structure. 

I was in a phase where I was going to Reiki every week, then immediately would go to my space, hit record, clear my head and play. I was going to warm up a demo from a notebook tonight, but decided to be spontaneous instead. It was a foggy day today, we were neck deep in what they now call an atmospheric river - I hear this in today's minute. This Wond makes me feel like I'm really singing through the instrument - thank you [Paul](https://voinventions.com/).
