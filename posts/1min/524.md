I'm on Lopez collecting sounds. Here's some Tunisian AM Radio I caught on the [University of Twente's online SDR](http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/). 

There's a cool instrumental break in here that almost sounds celtic - I'll post the earlier break tomorrow, that's in duple instead of the triple meter heard here.
