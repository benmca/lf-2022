Racoons chatting it up in Matt and Jean's backyard last night. We had a racoon family move in to our eave space last year - I tagged their cute speech on at the end. Another Ballard memory. It was a weird thing: where our default is to set traps to kill rats, there was no way to really rid our space of the racoon family without separating mom and babies, and wait for the babies to die. They will not be urged out, not with smoke or sound, both of which I tried. Interesting adaptation eh? I like the racoons after housing a family for a little while.
