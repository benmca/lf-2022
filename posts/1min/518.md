I've been picking up Voice of Turkey at 13635 on this [online shartwave radio](http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/).  I mainly know Erkin Koray's amazing stuff from the 70s, and maybe this is more Turkish rock, but shazam isn't recognizing it. Pretty heavy though - would pass for metal with more distortion.
