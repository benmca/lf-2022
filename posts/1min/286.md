Morning birds seemed to be laying beats down this morning. There's some sparrow cheep-ing, and an owl that I want to get a closer recording of. 

We finished our last Olalla chore for final inspection today, 4 covid cases sweatily planting oaks and mock oranges. Mike and I thought we were going to this taco truck, which Google maps said was nearby, but it was not there. Lies!
