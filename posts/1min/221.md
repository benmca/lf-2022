Got to meet Dweezil and listen the band rehearse for their show at the Moore. A gem and a brilliant even-keeled player. I'd love to see him taking a more active role in managing his father's legacy, but that isn't in the cards right now. Here they are rehearsing the challenging last lick of Punky's Whips.
