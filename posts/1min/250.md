While in Croatia this month, I was digging through some old tapes and found a recording of Radio Bulgaria I made from 2006. There's a scene in one of my favorite movies Never Cry Wolf, where the main character is listening to a distant broadcast just after he's been dropped off on the frozen tundra to begin his solo adventure studying Canis Lupis. I'm going to go see if this is the actual sound - it's got that Bulgarian articuation I love so much - potential transcription.  

Pictured is a piece by Vangel Naumovski seen in the Museum of Naive Art in Zagreb. I was deeply moved by these pieces - abstract but evoking a bit of Bosch's *Garden of Earthly Delights*.
