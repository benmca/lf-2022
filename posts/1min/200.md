Number 200! "2019.12.06.HiLonesome" - that 'High, Lonesome' sound is ... *kind of* on here but more sounds like a rural Japanese location I would like to visit in the 1920s. I dunno something like that. What's that word for awestruck+forlorn+contentment? The AI says "The word you're thinking of might be "saudade." Saudade is a Portuguese term that conveys a deep emotional state of nostalgic longing for something or someone that one loves, coupled with the knowledge that the object of longing might never return. It encapsulates feelings of love, loss, and melancholic contentment all at once." Never have heard that word but ok.
