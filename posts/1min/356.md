Edie (our dog) was going apeshit at Kim and Chris's party last night when Sean started singing. I wanted to post a bit of that here but no recording, alas, as I took her outside so everyone could hear.

Leesa, David, Sean and I talked at length about a [Cmon Cmon](https://cmoncmon.bandcamp.com/album/cmon-cmon) reunion and a remix of our second record.  I played this, the last track we did for that second, unreleased record, and Sean had no recollection of writing it. It's funny - he's the least prog listener (as far as I know anyways) of the three of us, but his tunes always end up having the busy riffs, usually played by guitar and bass in unison. I dig this tune and the rest of them, and with the push from Leesa our manager we'll get this thing rolling. Next step is to talk with Robert about flying out and staying a bit so we can rehearse and do a show.  I practiced laying some guitars on this thing.
