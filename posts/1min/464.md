In front of Varese's house in Greenwich Village, April 2022.  Unrelated to this audio: I love Integral√®s, and started on a guitar cult version of it. 

I've been a little blue about how difficult it is to restart this Guitar Cult recording project. Even with an abbreviated group, getting a trio together enough to re-engage with these pieces and creating momentum enough for a viable recording is proving difficult with schedules. I feel like these pieces are a novel I've been writing, and I need to cap off a first draft somehow or another. It's a theme for me this month - finalizing drafts so they can be shared and go live out there. 

I dunno - this guitar doesn't sound half bad to me.
