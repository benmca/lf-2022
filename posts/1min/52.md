I've been picking out Csound pieces that feel half-finished to me. There are lots of things sitting in my notebooks (or notebook drives), and I want to go back and explore them. This is a clip from a trippy little move I made called [*Circadia Sees the Moon* by Dave Hanagan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEthtMXC3c).  I very much have the Books first three records in my ears. I got caught up between sampling, programming and being musical, never achieving any kind of flow. Now that I'm learning TidalCycles, things are much more immediate and this won't be as much of an issue.
