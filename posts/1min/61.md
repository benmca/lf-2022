VCS3 vs Ebows on VERY cranked guitar, stroking the strings and leaving a harmonic behind, to be magnified by an ebow. I gave notating it a stab. One of those techniques I found by accident, and still need to explore. Lightly rubbing a wound string with your fingertip only generates a little bit of sound energy - you need a ton of gain for this to work, so I should give it a try w/a limited in the signal chain.
