I've been away from the Circular 4Track and thinking about what I want to change about it. The challenge I laid for myself was to reach some sort of "critical mass" in the loops I created with it, which a lot of times took.. time. In that time I lull the listener into mellow territory. I haven't been able to jump right into the critical mass, and I want to play with that. Here's a mix of a few moments of critical mass - still mellow yellow but, for me, it's the arrival point in each of these little unreleased recordings. 

This is Judas Priest graffiti Jason showed me up in Lynnwood which had been on the street since we were in high school.
