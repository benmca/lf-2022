Who can complain when lines like this flow out? Makes me get all emotional. I'm so lucky just to witness the music when it works. There's an plot I hear:

- Here's what happened today
- Here's where I was less-than-confident
- Here's the spot where I figured it out and could move on
- Here's where I saw the light at the end of the tunnel - the end of my list of chores.

Pictured is one of the chores - a little repair to the 118-year-old porch on our house. Also today I fixed a bug in the [player](https://www.listenfaster.com/main/player/) and I can cruise through the playlist without it bopping back to the beginning randomly.
