More Racine collage. 

First day back, I feel so reset and excited about digging into the archive project John and I schemed while in Racine. I really want o make this happen, and have my toes dipping in so many pools right now, my mind is on balancing the energizing music projects on the horizon with our energizing nesting going on in Olalla.  Like... this shed that Mike, Tim, Julie, Leesa and Anna started on while I was in Wisconsin.
