My musical practice felt so good from 2017-2020. I had Tuktu bleeding into the Guitar Cult, with big breaks in the summer to just play. I got real friendly with my beautiful acoustic Webber, and meeting John ([Stropes](https://www.stropes.com)) sent me into more confident playing than I'd previously experienced. I began to sit and improvise for long sessions. After an hour or so of wandering warmup, ideas came out fully formed. I imagined playing live and releasing something homespun, with the aesthetic of Leo's 6 & 12-string guitar and the Moosewood Cookbook guiding me. (I was enamored with the book ElectronMusic by Robert Devoe, which seems to be lost to the sands of internet time - I'm going to have to dig it out and share some images. The entire thing was handwritten on light brown paperstock.)
