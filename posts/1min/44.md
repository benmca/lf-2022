A blip from my Siberia (Chelyabinsk) trip in 1998 - I fell asleep listening to this Tuesday night. An rough draft of the soundscape that opened my first "real" piece created solely with computer, [Adrift](https://listenfastermusic.bandcamp.com/track/adrift). 

Also I'm doing transfers for Jon Davis - I hadn't seen a Sony Personal Cassette before - I was usually buying Kmart 3-packs for to save my Commodore 64 programs to.
