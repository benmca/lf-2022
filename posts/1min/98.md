Another stream of consciousness exercise made into a piece. I wrote this out - one of three studies - in Boonville without the aid of an instrument, on November 3, 2006. These three pieces were a Satori for me, a moment of awakening, where I hadn't trusted my self to freely write. This line has 2 others, as well as drum, in this sketch for a short-lived group I was planning with Seth and Barret. 

During the pandemic I practiced these deeply, these 3 little pieces, and they yielded surprise lessons.  I gave them more descriptive names - this one is Pick Angle, because I can't play it to speed without really working the pick angle like a paint brush during that third line.  This is the original setting I did, warts and all.
