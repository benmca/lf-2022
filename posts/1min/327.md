Spent the day hammering and sawing as we build a utility shed, then came in and improvised this. Jason said something about Andy Summers in reference to my playing, and I tried to remember how many times I have ripped off the guitar break he plays on [Someone to Talk To](https://youtu.be/8aBeQDeqEOg?t=88)
