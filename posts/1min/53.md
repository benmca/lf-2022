Headed up to Lopez today with Leesa, Kim and Chris, the dogs, and my Soundshark parabolic mic. I managed to catch some aquatic mystery sounds. There's a rock where the sea lions hang out all day and chat, but at night things really get rolling. This mic is crazy - the rock we're talking about is at least a 1/2 mile from the shore, but you can hear their conversations really clearly. What are they saying? It's like slowed-down speech, like they're living on a different time scale than we are. 

Check out the image: you can see quiter blurts in the 1st ten seconds, then a lot of complex vocalizations afterward.
