One of many Guitar Cult demos I lost track of once we started our move to Olalla. At the beginning of the pandemic I took my typical run from 61st + 8th in Ballard to the ridge above Golden Gardens, where the panorama of dramatic weather from the west is always crazy to see. So fortunate to live in such a beautiful place. On this particular day, I sat for 5 min and watched as storm clouds seems to materialize from nothing. I named this piece Low Clouds Blooming that night. Though I haven't finished it, I know it's going to be a good one. This is several bits from it.
