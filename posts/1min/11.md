Heading over to Olalla tonight and thinking about my Chapel show back in July. I took a bunch of slivers of birdsong, made some loops with my Circular 4 Track software, and slowly brought it up through the PA. The audience could hear lots of ambience coming in through the windows–kids playing outside, dogs barking, lots of birds–and it got confusing: are we hearing something outside or inside through the PA? The rhythmic dog was a giveaway to some.  Anyways, I'm gonna set the mics out tonight as the first snow of the season falls, hoping I catch an owl or a coyote.
