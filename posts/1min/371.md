Over the Christmas break I've been building a greenhouse and listening to music, in particular getting reacquainted with R. Stevie Moore. I first found him trawling music collections in Napster (1998 I think would be the year), hearing from people that he was in a similar genre to Ween - another home recordist, DIY pop songwriter when there were few of them - relative to now. He's in a class all by himself though, for the consistent quality of the songcraft. His renderings are so full of character and charm, and he's so damn prolific I am still discovering new things in his discography, which apparently tops out at 400 releases. Give him a chance. He inspires me a ton. I watched a doc on him last night, which is where this clip comes from. 

"I'm always recording. I have a diary of sound.  See, aren't you glad we're rolling tape? It doesn't matter: it captures stuff. And that's been part of my whole thing for yearsâ€“that's what I want to do.... the tapes are so easy to make. That's what's getting so strange about it. It's too easy for me to write songs and make silly things."
