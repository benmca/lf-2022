When you stop to think about how much you stop and think about MONEY, you may shrug like I am today. Chasing dollars. I love Alejandro Jodorowsky. In Jodowsky's Dune, he says, holding up some bills:


*The picture need to be exactly as I am dreaming the picture.*

*Is a dream. Don't change my dream.*

*This system make of us slaves.*

*Without dignity. Without depth.*

*With a devil in our pocket.*

[He holds up the bills]

*This incredible money are in the pocket.*

*This money. This shit.*

*This nothing.*

*This paper who have nothing inside.*

*Movies have heart.*

This is a random melody I made on my old broken down, belovedly out of tune upright which died during Covid. Soon I'll find another, but this one was special - a hand me down from brother David Russell (happy birthday again!) sometime in the early '10s. The tuners I tried to hire all told me to dispose of it pronto, but it kept coughing up little gems like this line, so I had to keep it. You fellow hoarders understand, right?
