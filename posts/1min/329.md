Love that Wond - haven't broken it out enough lately, but now that I've got tags and playlists for those tags, I am revisiting everything I've been doing with it. It's a device that really speaks to me, that I feel very much at home with. 

Lots of drillin today. I exchanged a bottle of whiskey for hay today.
