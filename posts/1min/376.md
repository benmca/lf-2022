I've been listening to shortwave through on [online sdr](http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/) after [reading about Alan Roe's guide to music on shortwave](https://swling.com/blog/2025/01/alan-roes-b-24-season-guide-to-music-on-shortwave-version-3-0/), and found some beautiful bits. This is from Voice of Turkey. So many intros like this end up stuck in my head and bounce around for a while, eventually spawning vairations that I end up writing down and turning into turns. There's a bucket of tunes that started off as (what I'd call) copies of bits like this.

I've started battling insomnia tonight, a spell that will stretch through the weekend.  One bonus is that the full moon has made the views at 3am super dramatic, as you see pictured here.
