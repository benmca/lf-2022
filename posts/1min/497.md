I have a pile of things to go through and (minimally) demo so I can bring them to either a) Caudal Peduncle practice b) Medicine Hat practice or c) Guitar Cult practice. This is called "2020.06.24.RV-11_15_lightsOut" and was something Thin Lizzy ish for Bryan and I to play in Rosso Viti. Still stuck in my head and I want to play it in something.
