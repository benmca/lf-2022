This is my little field recording rig, minus the parabolic mic from Soundshark. I put this out a few times a week and see what I can hear.

Here are some owls in the distance I recorded Friday night. The party always seems to happen around 4am, and always closer to our bedroom on nights I'm NOT recording. While the weather holds, I'm going to find a new spot each night to place it.
