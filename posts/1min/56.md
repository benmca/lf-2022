Another bit from [Circadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEthtMXC3c). Three simple elements, a little bit closer to goal: trying to make something that sounded like a circle out of these little clipped acoustics. I was really excited about this at the time, but it didn't seem to catch anyone's ears except filmmaker Dan (thankfully). I had just quit [Baby](https://listenfastermusic.bandcamp.com/album/the-prisoner-wanted-to-wrestle), was just wrapping Stupid Kids at the Empty Space with what-would-become [Cmon Cmon](https://cmoncmon.bandcamp.com/album/cmon-cmon), and about to start [Wizard Prison with Scott and John](https://wizardprison.bandcamp.com/).
