This line over Jason's funk was a pain for some reason - I couldn't settle on what left hand fingering to use. You check it out.  Still learning TidalCycles, and playing with how I might deploy a line from Tidal in sync with Ableton. It seems I need to anticipate either an 1/8th or a 1/4 note, but it doesn't seem consistent.
