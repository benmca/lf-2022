I stayed up and had a long clear-eyed talk about family history with my dad tonight. He was the youngest of six - four brothers and a sister to show him the way. I was born long after they all became parents, and after my grandfather had passed, so I never got to know him. He'd had a terrible set of experiences and financial missteps that left him damaged in some way, and my oldest uncle had been the surrogate father figure in the family even before he died in the late 60s, but I can't help but feel love for the guy I never met. Even on a night like this, where I'm talking with my dad while he processes it with me. I really got dealt a nice hand in the parent dept, and very much appreciate it on a night like this.
