From [Jan 15](https://www.listenfaster.com/main/15/): This thing has been called Slider Rays or Lines Above in my notebook for a little over five years. I like the angles, I like the slides, but it's static right now and it won't feel 'done' until I can take the idea and move it through some changing harmonies and vibes.
