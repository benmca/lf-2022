About 10 years ago I was working in an old industrial building in Ballard, listening to the sound of hammers on floorboards in the office space above mine. It was quiet so I caught the hammering clean, and it always reminded me of the opening of Boogie With Stu off *Physical Graffiti*.  Here it is beneath one of my Circular 4Track sketches. It's a dark mood tonight.
