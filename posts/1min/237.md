From [April 2](https://www.listenfaster.com/main/93/)

Big insomnia night last night as I ran inventory - aka monkey-minded - about all the things I think I must do. The chores required of us before we can move. The music I want to write but don't have time write now. On and on obsessive demons gnaw at my stomach until I can put thoughts to bed, usually with the aid of comedians in earbuds and 2 benadryl. Last night it didn't work, but Lenny Bruce, Mitch Hedburg, David Sedaris, Redd Foxx, Mike Birbiglia and Norm MacDonald all pitched in. I grabbed my guitar for a sec and played this little tidbit, wrapping it up today.
