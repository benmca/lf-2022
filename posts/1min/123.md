(From 5.1 session, 33:30ish)

This one reminds me of playing [Boston Sucks in Baby](https://listenfastermusic.bandcamp.com/track/boston-sucks) - I was so proud of my rapid fire D.Boon stylings. D. Boon lords over a chunk of my brain when I play with both of these guys. The abandon mixed with the melodicis, and the raw straight sound are something I click into with D in mind. "How can I believe in books when my heart lies to me? I'm full of shit! Bummin real hard on cold steel facts." Fucking genius lyricist to boot.
