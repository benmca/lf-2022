Not the most festive-sounding thing, this was in the same notebook as some of the stuff I found for [Bizzy Bizzy](https://www.listenfaster.com/main/352/) the other day. "Seed Dirge"? I have no idea why it was called this, but I remember try these changes out in quite a few [Baby](https://listenfastermusic.bandcamp.com/album/the-prisoner-wanted-to-wrestle) tunes.
