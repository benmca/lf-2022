Rabbit holed a bit into the [Dave Brubeck archive](https://www.brubeckcollection.org/) tonight (THANK YOU [DANETTE](https://www.danettedavis.com/)!). I hadn't broken out the Circular 4 track in awhile so here we go. There's a workflow emerging where I create loops w/the C4T then chop and splice in Live. It yields a headspace close to where I go when I'm tape pause composing, it has the immediacy (I make new material quickly) and a surprise element (I let my ear guide what I'm sampling into the loops, but am always unprepared for what I hear looped). There's also a filter that forms, a kind of boiling-down of the sound world I'm sampling, that has the scent of the original world but feels like another place at the same time. Hm.
