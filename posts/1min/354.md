Another Christmas arrangement, this one by Baby, my band with Josh Stewart, Ian Rashkin and Neil Wilson. Matt Wainwright, whom I have not spoken to in wayyyyyyyy too long, did the cover you see here. Damn I loved playing this song. One time we play the Ballard Firehouse and closed with this, and the crowd insisted we play it again.
