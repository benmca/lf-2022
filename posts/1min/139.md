![Japanese Pentathalon](/main/img/1min/139-2.png)

My notebook says this is Japanese Pentathalon for Piano. A little bit of squaring up and cutting up - just fingerpainting with this here today. Once I get back into our house I'll take a look through my last notebook - I think there's a longer notated version.

Mount Saint Helens Day. This is the view from Olalla that day - someone posted it on the Olalla Facebook group.
