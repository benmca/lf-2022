From [April 4](http://localhost:8080/main/95/):

I forgot I'd made this drum track to practice this study with. It's called Shifts, and if you notices the lines in the notation, you'll see why. I can barely play it at this tempo.

5 days without guitar practice time today, so I'm pining for my studies. Next week promises some relief.
