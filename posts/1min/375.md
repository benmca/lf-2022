I've been listening to shortwave through on [online sdr](http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/) after [reading about Alan Roe's guide to music on shortwave](https://swling.com/blog/2025/01/alan-roes-b-24-season-guide-to-music-on-shortwave-version-3-0/), and found some beautiful bits. I love how the lines and ornaments in the vocal are visible through this spectral view you see pictured here. T-shirt.
