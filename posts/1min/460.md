This apple tree is more than 50 years old and still truckin. Finally getting some tlc after years of being consumed by neighboring plants. A real zen afternoon, with NO crows, who were conspicuous in their absense - I'm so used to hearing them in Ballard. I had to add some to this little EP-133 jam.
