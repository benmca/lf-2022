Found an old recording of Gracie telling me a story when they were 5. I wrote a bunch of [Csound](https://csound.com/) and [Thuja](https://github.com/benmca/thuja) code to make some interlocking rhythms and added some texturesâ€“slices of a flute recording from Venice as well as bells ringing in St Mark's square, time signals over shortwave radio.
