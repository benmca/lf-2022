Insomnia take two. I tried to capture some of my state of mind in sound when I wrote this piece for orchestra called *Bizzy Bizzy*. In this section, I'm trying to evoke a hypnagogic image I had listening to the radio as I fell asleep. I gave each member of the group a section of text quoting Terrence McKenna on Art Bell's radio show, and asked them to read it aloud in an even, conversational tone. A good texture which I should exploit more. This is a doctored view of downtown from our office in Fremont.
