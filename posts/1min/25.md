I've been re-learning Ableton Live as part of this new collab with Neil and Jason. It's tripping me out how long I've been creating with this thing, albeit it on and off. One of the first things I did was a bunch of music for a game our company Artifact Technologies was doing back in 2015. The original name of this one is Jim's Morning - that's a picture of our boy Jim below, taken the same week I recorded this.

I found the mix on an old hard drive (I thought I'd lost these) - here's a little tweaky remix for Jason and Neil to check out. I've always liked the bass line. That's some tremolo on a shortwave recordding of Radio Cuba in the middle.
