"Tunnel" started out as a soundtrack for a car cruising the Alaskan Viaduct in Seattle. This originally sprung from the gentleman's songwriting club / band I had with David Russell, Sean Bates and Robert Walker called C'mon C'mon, and was one of many that were deemed "not right" for that band, but still pops up in my head frequently. I like the bass line and the pocket it gives the snare.
