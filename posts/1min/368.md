Working with John on promotion for the upcoming Leo Kottke of transcriptions from his first album, 6 and 12 String Guitar, and I'm watching a video of a party with Leo, Joe Pass, John Williams, Paco Pena and a bunch of folks from Georgia, singing a beautiful group vocal thing. There are some lovely changes in there, and soon I will be able to share the audio! Pictured: words to live by, from a gift John received from Taiwan.
