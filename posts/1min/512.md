Dusting off the ESQ-1 after years of dormancy, and sequencing it up with the EP-133. I played this synth so much with Wiz Priz, and used it in every soundtrack I did for by brother Andy. It's such a versatile awesome sounding synth. The programming is pretty intuitive even though all digital (no knowbs - all values on a menu you change with a slider or arrow buttons) 
but it's super quick to pick up.
