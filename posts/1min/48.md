Mama's birthday tonight - great times with great familly. Before bed I heard a wild chorus of Coyotes - not the distant cries we've heard in Olalla (which I'm posting here), but more voices, closer, countered with someone's distant howl. Was it a domestic or wild dog? I imagined it was a wolf. One of many nights I wish I'd been recording! The sounds have been stuck in my head all day.
