The tapepause conversations have started to become a bit more formulaic, at least in my mind. I listen for snares, repeating background percussion, or negative space between sections, and record that (or frame what I record around that). 

Here you'll hear the negative space in Scorpions *No One Like You*. The guitar from the preceding section (which I didn't record) bleeds into this negative space. There's also a perception of the room they recorded the drums in, or the reverb they were fed into. How should we notate negative space?
