This is from the very first version of the Circular 4 Track, from a live set I did in 2005 on KBCS 91.3 in Seattle. I was working on a music subscription service with my longtime friend Glen and a new bunch of people, all curious to know what my own music was like. This show aired from 12pm-3am if I remember right, so I'm not sure anyone of them actually listened to it live, but those who did reported extreme relaxation.  I like the sounds and the structure of this clip. A shot down our back alley _last_ Leap Year Day, 2020.
