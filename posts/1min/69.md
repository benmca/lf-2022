Lessons have been learned in using a power bank with my Roland R-07 recorder, and now I can take > 24hr recordings of an environment. From Friday night into Saturday morning, Olalla was very calm weather wise, and I manged to catch these coyotes. This night I imagine 3 or 4 individuals checking in with each other as they make their rounds. There's a backdrop of frogs that went quiet right away once the coyotes started in - you can hear them starting to vocalize around 1:50 - that's them around the 2k mark.

We caught so many coyotes on our game cam, wandering our lot before we we started building the house.  I think I'm going to hear lots variation - [here's another coyote post from last month](https://www.listenfaster.com/main/48/).
