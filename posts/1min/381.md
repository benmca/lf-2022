Lotsa noodling on old Medicine Hat songs. I liked this part of a tune we did, "Second Coming", but damn was it slow. I zhuzhed it up a bit and sped it up to 2x, and it sits with me nicely now. 

This notation has nothing to do with that. I had to post it though, for my sanity, so I could quickly find the corrected break in Breaking.
