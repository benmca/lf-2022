The only thing I really spent time with this Olympics was the breakdancing. To live to see something come from the Bronx in new segments and early MTV videos to seeing my first breakin live when I was 10 (1982) at Seattle Center to seeing Beat Street the day it came out in some Edmonds multiplex (probably Lynn Four or the Alderwood Mall) to THIS. Threaded through so many cultures and scenes made me all emotional - gives you hope for unity. This is the sound from the first round of qualifiers, Tom Ze's *Dor e Dor* kickin it off. This is the latest shot of Shelly under the Ballard Bridge.
