Next Guitar Cult time is on the 9th, so I'm cobbling together bits for exploration. This time around, I'm trying to resist the urge to pre-compose everything and take it more iteratively. Small bits. I found a bunch of things on the shelf, but this lil guy is a brain teaser. I can play the parts by themselves, and I can hear the beat behind them when there isn't one, but it REALLY doesn't gel until drums come in. It's like a backbeat is required. Here's a midi rendering from a version I wrote for Seth (piano) and Barret (viola) and I (gtr) to play, hoping that piano would be strong enough to keep the pulse.  But like I said, it takes a backbeat to really work.
