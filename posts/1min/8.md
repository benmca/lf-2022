Out on a long run earlier today, I was meditating on how I might notate some instructions for one of these tape pause things [like yesterday's minute](https://www.listenfaster.com/main/1min/7/).  Heady day at work, so between zooms I noodled around what symbols I could use, then made a little recording.

You'll see some new glyphs: 

- the "Tape Pause Clef" (that's supposed to be the sign for record and pause together in a box), 
- the "listen for" symbol (which looks like an ear with an arrow out the right side): here the player listens for a sound and, once that sound is recognized, can move on to the next thing. I've used this one a bunch in the past and I _thing_ I invented it?

Also an attempt to explain in an efficient way what is happening when you perform each section.
