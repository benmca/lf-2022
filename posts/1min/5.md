I was on a flight and had this melody stuck in my head, so like I often do I record it on the phone and transcribe it later. This one sounds so simple in my head, but is weird when I play it. In my head, the arrangement sounds something like this. Very rough stiched-together transcription from my notebook - might have to recopy that.
