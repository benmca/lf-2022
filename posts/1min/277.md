Tape pausing with a piece of my own. Makes me think of the structures differently.   I made this image in 30 seconds with chatgpt, which I've been using a lot lately to learn and do really bespoke audio cataloging scripts with, so on an ascending familiarity scale of 1-5, I'm a 3 and starting to note when I stop thinking and farm out thinking to the thing. Inevitable when you are learning these tools, and a weird feeling.
