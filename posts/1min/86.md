Lotta motion in this one. I recorded this piecemeal and laid some quotes from one of my Circular 4Track cuts ("Pulse Drop 2s"). 

Today was one of those days where I'm socialed out by 5pm - playing lines like this ground and refuel me. I hope someone out there gives one of these a spin someday and get the same recharge I do.
