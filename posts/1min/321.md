I pulled out the DAT to do some transfers for John, and found a rehearsal tape for a piece I wrote in 99/2000 called From Mixdown. Growing pains for me. I listened to a little bit of this and lost sleep thinking about how tortured and anxious music used to make me, how much pressure I put on myself to strike a new path, no matter what it sounded like. And Carsten worked so hard to play my little guitar collage! Even 25 years ago I was trying to do something with the Oswald Plunderphonic influence. 

Now I'm contemplating playing nothing for anyone unless it's familiar, unless there's a hook in, an invitation. I won't be joining a cover band, but I think 2025 will have me spending a lot of time trying to connect with and grow the audience.
