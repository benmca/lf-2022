Sometimes you get to feeling down, unfed, ungrounded as a musician. You gotta remember this recording from November 1, 2017. You had just started doing Reiki and Acupuncture combined, and had a very out-of-body experience at the session, then went to your space, plugged in, and improvised this. It turned into your piece Skips, pretty much as originally played.  This is you in touch with the other, the universe, spirit, god. Don't forget this.
