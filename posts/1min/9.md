On the way home from practice, thinking about the last two posts. Will these tape pause pieces always sound frenetic? Can I make something soothing for bedtime? My first thought was to find some solo music–music for one instrument–on the radio; it turns out that KING-FM (the classical station) was the only option. This also features the first thunderstorm I recorded (in 1996!), as I try to capture what Ballard felt like last night during the big storm.
