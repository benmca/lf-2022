This morning we go in to begin laying drum basics down for a Guitar Cult record, finally. John and I playing scratch while we support Neil's live takes. First up is Square this morning, which you'll hear more of soon, but this morning it's the last of the surverying of Guitar Cult demos for a little while. This is "2022.06.20.Skips 2 with Slides" - another expansion of an idea from the 1st Skips movement.
