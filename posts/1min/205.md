This one is triggering those "should I post this or not" feels but I'm going to go for it, since C'mon C'mon has been on my brain since I saw David last week. I was real proud of this song about Leesa and I living in Maple Leaf and trying to keep the fact that we were going out hidden from our roommates. The bridge was replaced by something different and I clean forgot about this - the 'get in the way' harmonies are kind of cool right? The finished product is soon to come - I'll post it in another day or so. Here are 75% of C'mon C'mon recording the album in question at Buttermilk on Beacon Hill in Seattle. 

I have to note - if only for myself - that last night there were the most insane owl calls happening around 2am. I was too lazy to get the recorders out to capture, and have been kicking myself all day. Hopefully they are out again, tonight.
