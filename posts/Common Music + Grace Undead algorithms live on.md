*2022 note: CM may nearly be a dead project, so I'm publishing this more for myself.*

I’ve been getting reacquainted with Common Music and Grace for
the past few weeks, looking at old pieces I create in CM 1.4 and
porting them as I go to CM 3.9. I’ll be keeping some notes here which
may morph into posts on a separate blog/forum/site dedicated to CM.


For now, here are the relevant online resources I’ve been able to identify:

## Specific to Common Music:

[Main Common Music page](http://commonmusic.sourceforge.net/)

[Common Music Dictionary](http://commonmusic.sourceforge.net/cm/res/doc/cm.html)

[The CM Dist Mailing List](https://cm-mail.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/cmdist)

[Taube’s Notes from the MetaLevel is best acquired through Amazon AFAIK](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9026519575)

[Csound Journal article on CM/Grace](http://csoundjournal.com/issue19/grace_scheme_csound.html)

[For oldtimers like me, the pre-2002 cmdist archives can be useful](ftp://ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/Lisp/old-cmdist.html)

[Grace builds are archived here.](http://camil.music.illinois.edu/software/grace/) I had a problem with the latest Mac build available through the App Store, but found a working package here.

## Scheme and other relevant resources:

[Schemers.org](http://www.schemers.org/) - hub of the online Scheme community. CM is an extension of Scheme, which in turn is a dialect of Lisp.

[One python programmer’s notes on learning scheme](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=251474). He’s a good writer so it’s a fun read.

[Main S7 page](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/main/snd/snd/s7.html) - S7 is an extension of Scheme which CM leverages.

Two free books! [The Scheme Programming Language](http://www.scheme.com/tspl2d/) and [Practical Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/)
