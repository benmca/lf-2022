## [Lines Community - the Experimental music notation resources](https://llllllll.co/t/experimental-music-notation-resources/149)

I have killed hours just looking through the posts on this thread. 

## [Elektronauts EP-133 thread](https://www.elektronauts.com/t/teenage-engineering-ep-133-k-o-ii/203660)

I'm super mindful of the time I spend on anything social-media flavored, but I love forums. They're like BBSs, which would be my preferred way of discussing stuff online. Reddit hasn't sucked me in yet like this place and Lines (see above).


## [Venus Theory's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@VenusTheory)

Jason sent me this video and I started listening to a lot of his rants. It's mostly common sense, but concisely put. Good for people to hear if they are older than 40 and trying to wrap their heads around being a musician in today's world.

## [Muse](https://museapp.com/)

I'm trying to embrace the form more and go digital with my brainstorming. From [Ink and Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/).

## [WREKage](https://www.wrekage.org/playlists.php)

I forgot about this, one of the oldest online streaming metal shows. KCMU (now KEXP) had Brain Pain in the 80s - this is the closest thing I've found.  

## [Absorptions blog](https://www.windytan.com/)

This had gone dark for a bit, so I was happy to see a new post. Always very technical and thought-provoking, [this](https://www.windytan.com/2021/03/speech-to-birdsong-conversion.html) post on converting human speech to birdsong was the reason I bookmarked it originally.

## StrangeLoop talk on sound, bird song, code, keytars: 

Right up my alley, a reminder to check out [Overtone](https://overtone.github.io/) again.

## [Strangeloop Programmable Ink Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifYuvgXZ108)

Food for thought when I think about bridging the analog and digital in music notation.
