*I try to keep this list up to date and healthy - email me if you have additions.*

Friends: I'd like to see many things about 2021 go away.  I've got a pile of new year's resolutions.  For those of you who know what I'm talking about, maybe you'll join me in adding this small one to your list: let's work to abolish these wrong corporate-speak habits from the English language forever. 

- Referring to the near future as a thing called "a go-forward" i.e. From a 'go-forward' perspective
- Overuse of the word perspective, period.
- Calling the learning process "Ramping up"
- Calling your first day on a new project "onboarding"  
- Saying more or less sophisticated when you mean 'dumb'
- When you mean "I want to have a private chat about this (and I have feelings about this topic)" but you say "maybe it's a separate conversation. Lets take it offline."
- When you have choices, you say you have optionality
- Using "Robust" to talk about a bunch of ways to maximize $$ 
- ^^ There I did it - stop saying maximize/optimize for everything you want to improve
- Overuse of 'Driving' when headed to a goal. 
- Pronouncing EBITDA instead of saying 'Net' for financial things - though everyone insists you need to use the 'right' word here. 
- 'Circle back' to revisit a topic.
