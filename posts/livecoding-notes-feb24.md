I've been exploring new tools for generating sound, particularly things I've learned about via [toplap](https://toplap.org), and I'll keep my notes from Feb here. I've joined Mastodon via [the toplap server](https://social.toplap.org/home) - you might consider it. Really friendly community so far - nothing like my first dumb twitter experience.

After spending a lot of time with TidalCycles this week, I watched @linalab's set at the Berlin's algo10 hosted by transmediale - here's where their set starts in the 6+ hour long video on YT.  How cool to learn the basics in one day, then watch a pro do some beautiful things with this tool.
