My brother's second feature film was more serious and surreal than its predecessor with a more fleshed out story and stylized look. The heightened visual impact made scoring much easier, and we both became very passionate about which music should go where. Many scenes had more than one "solution" from a compositional sense. In the end some music written was set aside in favor of other pieces which fit better the action better. As a result, many "bonus tracks" from the _Urban Scarecrow_ score exist.

Here's some of the music I composed for Urban Scarecrow (Tracks 4-9):
