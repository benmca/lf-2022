Having cranked out a few beautiful little numbers for a film he had in mind, my brother Andy hit me with the script for his first feature film, <em>Shag Carpet Sunset</em> and asked me to score it. True adulthood was just beginning to appear on our horizons so the film's references to our childhood which are strung throughout the plot devices killed me. Bravely made in Seattle as the city too was transitioning from its own sleepy, maritime adolescence.

This music would not exist with out the help of my good friend Neil Wilson. His awesome drumming can be heard throughout the soundtrack.

Here's some of the music I composed for Shag Carpet Sunset (Tracks 1-5, 16):
