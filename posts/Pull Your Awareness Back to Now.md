# Be able to pull your awareness 
# back to now
# be here now
# when you need to be.

This piece is fun - it's an exercise in awareness, and a challenge to dexterity.

Read bars 1-2, then examine bars 3-4. Barely a change, right? Each bar introduces a new, very slight change, that will mess with your muscle memory.

Play bars 1-2 until you know them by heart, and look at bars 3-4 _while you continue to play 1-2_. Do you make a mistake?

Try to picture playing bars 3-4 while playing bars 1-2. **What do you observe?**
