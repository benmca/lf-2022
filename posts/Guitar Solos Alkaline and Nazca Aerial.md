In 2004, I was invited to participate in the Big Sur Experimental
Music Festival’s Sound Shift piece, and had no solo albums to bring.  I
had group recordings where my out-guitar voice occasionally shone
through but had nothing to say ‘here’s what I’m doin’.  With this gig
as goal, I set my mind to channeling my recent software experiments, my
film work, and my love of Fred Frith and Hans Reichel into a focused
release.  I gave a few concerts (audio below), playing improvs crafted
with my software I dubbed ‘the glitchy delay’.  This software was
inspired by Scandinavian minimalist electronic stuff I’d heard on the
Komplott and Fukkgod netlabels – I was particularly taken with
Tsukimono.  

At any rate, the pieces on the album quickly found their way into two scores I was doing: one for Brandon Schmid’s Taos, one for Brandon Schaeffer's Emergency Pants Collection.  I pressed a few hundred, sold them, and got on.
