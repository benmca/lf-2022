# Past Events

[Medicine Hat w/Give and Chimestone]() 

Royal Room, Seattle | November 17, 2023 

Our 90s angular hardcore band is reuniting for the first time in 15, for only the second time since our peak in the 90s. We're pretty excited to be getting together to play the [classics from this record](https://listenfastermusic.bandcamp.com/album/medicine-hat). Though we no longer look like we did [this time we were 'on tv'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHGJb1pCbWk) - we are still pretty smokin hot, I promise. We will be sharing more here and on the socials as we get closer to show time. Thanks to brother Chris Friel for his positive vibes in getting us together.
