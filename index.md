<div id="home-body">

A composer and guitarist based in Seattle, I've played with a string of boundary-pushing groups 
including Medicine Hat, Degenerate Art Ensemble, Wizard Prison, C’mon C’mon and Tuktu. 
I co-host the Articulations podcast w/Joshua Kohl. I’m the founder of the [Guitar Cult](http://theguitarcult.com/), my current focus, a 7-piece electric guitar group interpreting my pieces. I periodically share audio I've made along the way in my My Sounds sound journal series, [available on Bandcamp](https://listenfastermusic.bandcamp.com/).  My guitar music is available from [Stropes Editions](https://www.stropes.com/ben-mcallister/).
