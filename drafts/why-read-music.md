I'm going to develop a list of questions and answers here to tease out the reason / rationale for learning to read and write with notation. 

Why, in this day and age, would we bother with notation? Why read? 

Accessibility - technology has made many sounds available, but so much is capture on paper that hasn't been recorded. Joe Gore is the first in ages to bring it up in his new book.

Thought process  - diff between: if I play and record, revisit and record vs. play, notate, leave that and come back to it. Notebooks vs mixtapes.  Rush recording constantly vs smartphone immediacy when discovery strikes vs the focus that comes into play during focused notation.

What is captured on paper that is missed in recording?
